# Create a React website that uses a graphql API

Use the provided graphql api (apollo server,) to create a React webpage that shows information about an upcoming football match. 

Show football match:
Initial teams arrangement, where and when it's played.
The basic layout should have the two teams side by side with their starter linenup listed on each container, with the following data per player:

|lastname|firstname|position|squadNumber|


Sorting:
The listing should include controls to sort by lastname, position or squad number.

Click into Detail
Clicking on a player should bring up that player's detailed information on a separate screen.

## Constraints

- The website must be a SPA made in React
- A simple instructable on how to view the example. Dependency `install` and `start` steps, at most.
- Upload your solution to Github/Gitlab and then share it with us.

You are free to expand on the graphql API and its server, but without taking aways what's already in there.
You can also anotate usage documentation in the way you see fit.
